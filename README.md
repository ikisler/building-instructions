#Lego Building Instructions App
###Code by Isabeau Kisler
**Uses Cubiculus API**

###The Project
Web application that displays random building instructions based on category.

###Situation Report
Code currently does not work, due to issues with Cubiculus API.

This works using JSONP and this query:
http://www.cubiculus.com/api-rest/lego-set/{API-KEY}/10187

However, using JSONP or CORS, this query does not work:
http://www.cubiculus.com/api-rest/building-instruction/{API-KEY}

This project has been put aside for now until these issues can be resolved.
